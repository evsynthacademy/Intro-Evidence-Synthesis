## What systematic reviews can’t do

So, a systematic review is a helpful tool, but it’s not a magical process for answering any question. How do you know a systematic review is the best approach for you?

Let’s use a scientific example. The chart below illustrates the number of published research studies about pain management in newborn babies between 1939 and 2016.

You’ll see in this chart that the number of published articles about pain in newborn babies increased exponentially around 1990. This publication trend occurred after an [important paper about newborn babies and pain](http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/anand/) was published in 1987 by Anand & Hickey in the New England Journal of Medicine. 

If this was 1986 and we wanted to conduct a systematic review about pain in newborn babies , we wouldn’t have a lot of material to use. 

That’s why, before you invest too much time in a systematic review, your first step is making sure there’s enough existing research about the topic you care about. Because if no one has written about your question, or only a few people have written about it, you won’t have enough evidence to synthesize. 

**A systematic review is the wrong tool for your question if**:

1. **Research on your topic doesn’t exist**<br>
In the above chart, you can see that before 1948, PubMed has no evidence of published literature about pain in newborn babies. So, you can’t synthesize research from before 1948 because it doesn’t exist. <br>
Remember, If you can’t find research on these topics, it doesn’t necessarily mean no one has asked these questions, it just means no one has done a full study or published the findings.
2. **There’s not enough research on your question**<br>
The number of publications on the topic of newborn babies and pain were limited until 1987, when the Anand & Hickey paper ushered in a new area of research on newborn pain. If we tried to synthesize the research written before 1987, we wouldn’t have enough information to make an informed decision. 
3. **Your question can’t be answered with a systematic review**<br>
We can learn a lot about how infant pain has been studied since 1987 by synthesizing existing research, but we’re less likely to find the answer to more philosophical or historical questions such as “Why is there a shortage of research about pain management for newborns?” 

Still think a systematic review will address your needs? On the next page, we’ll discuss the logistics for getting started.
