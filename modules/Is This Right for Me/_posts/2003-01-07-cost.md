## How much does it cost?

<br>



The cost depends on how complicated your systematic review is, how quickly you need to get it done, and how big your team is.

To give you a rough estimate, the federal government pays about $250,000- $500,000 for a systematic review. But donâ€™t be intimidated by that price tag. You can conduct a less rigorous systematic review, perhaps with the help of volunteers or interns, for a lot less money. In fact, many students or research trainees conduct systematic reviews as a first research project on their own time.
