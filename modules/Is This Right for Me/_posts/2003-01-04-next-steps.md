## Next Steps

Now that you’ve learned about systematic reviews, what do you want to do next?

### I’m ready to get started!

You know what a systematic review is, you think it can help you answer an important  question, and you have the time and resources to make it happen. Dive in and take our course on how to conduct a systematic review. [Link to Val’s course]

### A systematic review is too involved for my needs, but I’m excited about evidence synthesis.

Maybe a less complicated approach to evidence synthesis could fit your needs. Take a look at these other types of evidence synthesis [link to chart on types of evidence synthesis] We’re also happy to talk with you about your options.

### I don’t want to conduct a systematic review, but I want to learn more.
