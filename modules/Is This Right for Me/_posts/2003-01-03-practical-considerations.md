## Practical Considerations for Systematic Reviews

Here are answers to some practical questions about conducting a systematic review:

Remember, each systematic review is different depending on the question you’re asking and how much evidence exists.

1. **How long does it take to conduct a systematic review?**<br>
The time it takes to conduct a systematic review will depend on how much evidence exists, the kind of questions you’re asking, how much help you have and whether you need to ask for additional information from researchers who conducted the primary studies.<br>
It is possible to conduct a review in a very short time, even just a few days, but that’s when the question is narrow, the researchers know where to search, they find only a few papers, and the end product is a simple analysis or description of the findings. <br>
Many researchers working in small teams can do a review in a couple of months, even shorter if they work on the project full time. 
<br>
But, in general a comprehensive review on a topic with multiple questions for a paying sponsor will take you much longer. CESH can conduct “rapid turnaround” systematic reviews in about four months. These reviews require a lot of effort from our team and are only possible if the systematic review is fairly straightforward. <br>
A typical systematic review for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHQR) can take 42 to 58 weeks. 
2. **What kind of team do I need?**<br>
These are the types of people who often work together to conduct a systematic review. Depending on your resources, you might have the same person filling several of these roles:<br> 
    - **Project lead/methods expert**<br>
    This person oversees the process and has expertise in the methods for conducting a systematic review. In some cases you might have two people fill this role- a project lead and a methods expert. 
    - **Statistician/quantitative expert**<br>
    Your team should include someone with expertise in analyzing data. In some cases, your methods expert will fill this role. 
    - **Librarian**<br>
    You’ll need a librarian to help you design your “search strategy.” This involves everything from using the right search terms in electronic databases to knowing what databases and sources to use. In some cases, your methods expert can fill this role.
    - **Clinical/subject area experts**<br>
These people are experts on the question you’re exploring. They help you understand the general landscape of research on this topic and evaluate which research is relevant. They can also help you frame your research question and interpret your findings so your results are relevant to decision makers.
    - **Research assistant(s)**<br>
    Research assistants do a lot of the intensive labor for a systematic review. Their tasks include data extraction, literature screening, data analysts, and strength of evidence/risk of bias assessments.
<br>
You might also want to include these people in your process:
    - **Stakeholders**<br>
Stakeholders are members of the community with a personal/financial/policymaking interest in the topic you’re exploring. Depending on your question, stakeholders could be your clinical or subject area experts, but you might also want to include advocates, policy makers, clinicians, payers, purchasers or patients. Stakeholders can play a valuable role in helping you shape your initial question and assess the relevancy of your results.
    - **Data visualization experts**<br>
Data visualization experts can help you present your findings in a compelling and clear format. 
    - **Dissemination partners**<br>
Once you’ve finished your systematic review, you’ll want to share your results. Dissemination partners can help you spread the word about your findings.
3. **How much does it cost?**<br>
The cost depends on how complicated your systematic review is, how quickly you need to get it done, and how big your team is.

To give you a rough estimate, the federal government pays about $250,000- $500,000 for a systematic review. But don’t be intimidated by that price tag. You can conduct a less rigorous systematic review, perhaps with the help of volunteers or interns, for a lot less money. In fact, many students or research trainees conduct systematic reviews as a first research project on their own time.
