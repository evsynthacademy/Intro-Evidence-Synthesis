## Practical Considerations for Systematic Reviews

Here are answers to some practical questions about conducting a systematic review:

Remember, each systematic review is different depending on the question you’re asking and how much evidence exists, so be sure to talk through your specific situation with the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health before you make any big plans.

1. **How long does it take to conduct a systematic review?**<br>
The time it takes to conduct a systematic review will depend on how much evidence exists, the kind of question you’re asking, and how much help you have, but here are some examples to get you started: 
    - **Simple question and fast turn around: about four months**<br>
      CESH can conduct “rapid turnaround” systematic reviews in about four months. These reviews require a lot of effort from our team and are only possible if the systematic review is fairly straightforward.
    - **A typical timeline: about a year**<br>
    When CESH conducts a systematic review for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHQR), it takes around 42 to 58 weeks. However, the timeline can vary depending on the type of review and how complex it is. 
    - **Conducting a systematic review alone: 10 years**<br>
    We’ve heard of researchers who’ve spent more than a decade trying to conduct a systematic review on their own. Don’t let this be you! 
2. **What kind of team do I need?**<br>
These are the types of people who work together to conduct a systematic review:
    - **Project lead/methods expert**<br>
    This person oversees the process and has expertise in the methods for conducting a systematic review. In some cases you might have two people fill this role- a project lead and a methods expert. 
    - **Statistician/quantitative expert**<br>
    Your team should include someone with expertise in analyzing data. In some cases, your methods expert will fill this role. 
    - **Librarian**<br>
    You’ll need a librarian to help you design your “search strategy.” This involves everything from using the right search terms in electronic databases to knowing what databases and sources to use. 
    - **Clinical/subject area experts**<br>
These people are experts on the question you’re exploring. They help you understand the general landscape of research on this topic and evaluate which research is relevant. They can also help you frame your research question so your results are relevant to decision makers.
    - **Research assistant(s)**<br>
    Research assistants do a lot of the intensive labor for a systematic review. Their tasks include data extraction, literature screening, data analysts, and strength of evidence/risk of bias assessments.
<br>
You might also want to include these people in your process:
    - **Stakeholders**<br>
Stakeholders are members of the community with a personal/financial/policymaking interest in the topic you’re exploring. Depending on your question, stakeholders could be your clinical or subject area experts, but you might also want to include advocates, policy makers, clinicians, payers, purchasers or patients. Stakeholders can play a valuable role in helping you shape your initial question and assess the relevancy of your results.
    - **Data visualization experts**<br>
Data visualization experts can help you present your findings in a compelling and clear format. 
    - **Dissemination partners**<br>
Once you’ve finished your systematic review, you’ll want to share your results. Dissemination partners can help you spread the word about your findings.
3. **How much does it cost?**<br>
The cost depends on how complicated your systematic review is, how quickly you need to get it done, and how big your team is. 

To give you a rough estimate, [in a 2017 study that analyzed the time it took to conduct and publish a systematic review](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/2/e012545#T2), researchers found that the average estimated time was 67.3 weeks. So, you can make a rough estimate of your costs based on the hourly rates of your team members.
