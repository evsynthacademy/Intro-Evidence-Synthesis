# Practical Considerations for Systematic Reviews

So, you think you want to conduct a systematic review!  Here are answers to some practical questions about the process. 

*Remember, each systematic review is different depending on the question you’re asking and how much evidence exists, so be sure to talk through your specific situation with the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health before you make any big plans.*

### 1. How long does it take to conduct a systematic review?
		
The time it takes to conduct a systematic review will depend on how much evidence exists, the kind of question you’re asking, and how much help you have, but here are some examples to get you started: 

#### Simple question and fast turn around: about four months

The Center can conduct “rapid turnaround” systematic reviews in about four months. These reviews require a lot of effort from our team and are only possible if the systematic review is fairly simple.

#### A typical timeline: about a year

When the Center conducts a systematic review for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHQR), it takes around 42 to 58 weeks.

### Conducting a systematic review alone: 10 years

We’ve met one researcher who’s been a conducting systematic review on his own for more than a decade. Don’t let this be you! Partner with the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health.

### 2. What kind of team do I need?
		
Here are the types of people you’ll need to conduct a systematic review:

#### Project lead/method expert
This person oversees the process and has expertise in the methods for conducting a systematic review. In some cases you might have two people fill this role- a project lead and a method expert.

#### Librarian
You’ll need a librarian to help you design your “search strategy.” This involves everything from using the right search terms in electronic databases to knowing what databases/sources to use. 

#### Clinical/subject area experts
These people are experts on the question you’re exploring. They help you understand the general landscape of research on this topic and evaluate which research is relevant. 

#### Research assistant(s)
Research assistants do a lot of the grunt work for a systematic review. Their tasks include data extraction, literature screening, data analysts, and strength of evidence/risk of bias assessments.

You might also want to include these people in your process:

#### Stakeholders
Stakeholders can play a valuable role in helping you shape your initial question and assess the relevancy of your results.

#### Data visualization experts
Data visualization experts can help you present your findings in a compelling and clear format. 

#### Dissemination partners
Once you’ve finished your systematic review, you’ll want to share your results. Dissemination partners can help you spread the word about your findings.

### 3. How much does it cost?

The cost depends on how complicated your systematic review is, how quickly you need to get it done, and how big your team is. 

According to a 1999 JAMA article, it can take up to 2,500 hours to conduct a systematic review and the average systematic review takes about 1,139 hours. So, you can make a rough estimate of your costs based on the hourly rates of your team members.
