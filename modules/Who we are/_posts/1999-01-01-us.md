## Who We Are: The Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health!


At the [Center for Evidence Synthesis](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-synthesis-in-health/about/history), we strive to improve health and wellbeing of individuals and populations. We promote rational decision making by conducting research in, and teaching the principles of, research synthesis (systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant and aggregate data) and evidence contextualization (decision and economic modeling).

Our [research](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-based-medicine/research-initiatives) and [training programs](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-based-medicine/education-and-training/innovative-training-improve-cer-pcor-systematic-review-production-and-uptake-) provide experiential learning and research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scholars, and faculty and healthcare professionals within and outside the Brown community. 

We develop [methods](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-based-medicine/research-initiatives/technical-reports),  [software tools](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-synthesis-in-health/research-initiatives/software-0), and apply these to solve important health concerns.  

The Center includes [statisticians, clinicians, epidemiologists, librarians, computer scientists, and health services researchers](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-based-medicine/about/people). We [collaborate](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-based-medicine/collaborations) with diverse groups of scholars and professional societies worldwide, in health and other disciplines.  These collaborations have led to numerous [publications](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-based-medicine/research-initiatives/publications) in many fields.
