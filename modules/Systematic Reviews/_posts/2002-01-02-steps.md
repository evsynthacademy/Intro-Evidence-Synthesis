If you wanted to conduct a systematic review, how would you do it?  What are the steps?

A systematic review follows six main steps:

1. **[Prepare your topic](#prepare-your-topic)**: Do enough research to craft questions that are specific and relevant
2. **Search for studies**: Find research studies that are potentially related to your question
3.  **Screen studies**: Discard studies that don’t address your question or have flawed research methods
4. **Extract data**: Collect  relevant data from all the remaining studies
5. **Analyze and synthesize data**: Evaluate the information you’ve collected from these studies to answer the question asked.
6. **Report your findings**: Turn the synthesis of information into a coherent narrative of what you’ve discovered.

#### Prepare your topic

If you’re interested in conducting a systematic review, you probably already have a question or a topic to explore. But how do you know whether this question can be effectively answered? The topic may be too broad and may have too many answers that can only be resolved by narrowing it down. Or the topic may be too narrow and may never have been studied. It is important to take an initial look at the available evidence to make sure there’s enough research to address your question. You should also carefully consider how an answer might be used. Then, craft a question that’s clear and specific enough to guide what kind of studies should and shouldn’t be included in your search.  

#### Search and screen studies

Once you’ve written a clear and specific question, you cast a wide net to find studies that might be related to your topic. Then, you take a closer look at those studies, removing any that don’t address your specific question or that have study features that you want to avoid. You may need to look at the studies you find pretty carefully to do this right..

#### Extract Data

Using the relevant studies you have identified, you pull out the information that will help you answer your question. You’ll use a data extraction form to help you organize and categorize what you find.  

#### Analyze and synthesize data

Once the data have been extracted and organized, you will need to carefully evaluate what you have found  and draw conclusions. If you’re conducting meta-analysis, this is where you use statistical tools to combine your data. You may also decide at this point that some of the studies lack sufficient information or are too poor to use.

#### Report your findings

This is the final step. Once you’ve drawn conclusions based on the evidence, you write a clear narrative of the steps you took and what you discovered.

For now, let’s look at how the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health has used systematic reviews to answer important clinical questions.
