Ok, so we now know that Systematic Reviews are more than just in depth literature reviews, but if you wanted to conduct a systematic review, how would you do it?  What are the steps?

Put simply, a systematic review contains six main steps:

1. **Prepare your topic**: Do enough research to craft a question that is specific and relevant
2. **Search for studies**: Look for research studies related to your question
3. **Screen studies**: Throw out studies that don’t address your question or have questionable research methods
4. **Extract data**: take out relevant data from all the remaining studies
5. **Analyze and synthesize data**: combine the data you’ve removed from these studies and analyze the results
6. **Report your findings**
