##  Extract Data

<br>

Using the relevant studies you have identified, you pull out the information that will help you answer your question. You’ll use a data extraction form to help you organize and categorize what you find. 

This is more difficult than it might seem. You may find factual inconsistencies between articles, even if they’re written by the same authors about the same study.  Even within a single article, you might find facts that don’t agree. For instance, the text of an article might not match the data in its tables.
