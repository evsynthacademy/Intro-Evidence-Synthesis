If you wanted to conduct a systematic review, how would you do it?  What are the steps?

A systematic review follows six main steps:

1. **Prepare your topic**: Talk with stakeholders and experts and do a quick scan of available research to craft questions that are specific and relevant
2. **Search for studies**: Find research studies that are potentially related to your question
3.  **Screen studies**: Exclude studies that don’t address your question.
4. **Extract data**: Collect  relevant data from all the remaining studies
5. **Analyze and synthesize data**: Evaluate the information you’ve collected from these studies to answer the question asked.
6. **Report your findings**: Turn the synthesis of information into a coherent narrative of what you’ve discovered.
