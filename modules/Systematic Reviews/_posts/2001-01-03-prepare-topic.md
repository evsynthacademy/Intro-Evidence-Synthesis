## Prepare your topic

If you’re interested in conducting a systematic review, you probably already have a question or a topic to explore. But how do you know whether this question can be effectively answered? The topic may be too broad and may have too many answers that can only be resolved by narrowing it down. Or the topic may be too narrow and may never have been studied. It is important to take an initial look at the available evidence to make sure there’s enough research to address your question. You should also carefully consider how an answer might be used. Then, craft a question that’s clear and specific enough to guide what kind of studies should and shouldn’t be included in your search.
