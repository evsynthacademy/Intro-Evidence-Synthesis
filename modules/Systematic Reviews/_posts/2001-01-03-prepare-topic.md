## Prepare your topic

If you’re interested in conducting a systematic review, you probably already have a question or a topic to explore. But how do you know whether this question can be effectively answered? The topic may be too broad and may have too many answers that can only be resolved by narrowing it down. Or the topic may be too narrow and may never have been studied. It is important to take an initial look at the available evidence to make sure there’s enough research to address your question. You should also carefully consider how an answer might be used. Then, craft a question that’s clear and specific enough to guide what kind of studies should and shouldn’t be included in your search.  

#### Search and screen studies

Once you’ve written a clear and specific question, you cast a wide net to find studies that might be related to your topic.  While you’re searching, be aware that the studies that make it to publication don’t reflect the entire body of research on a topic. Studies might go unpublished for a lot of reasons: perhaps their results aren’t statistically significant or their conclusions aren’t novel enough to get attention. This is called **publication bias**.

You can help combat publication bias by seeking out unpublished research, checking out work presented at academic conferences, and considering other “grey literature” such as reports by government agencies and non-profits.

Another common problem in the published literature is **reporting bias**, when a study is published without all of its results, perhaps because some results are considered secondary or not newsworthy. However, if the results are negative, failure to include them in the systematic review can bias your findings. You can combat reporting bias by following up with the authors of your studies to see if any results were left out. You can also compare the published results of a study with its protocol, which is written ahead of time. It’s easy to look up protocols for funded trials at Clinicaltrials.gov.

Once you’ve gathered a diverse collection of studies, you take a closer look, removing any studies that don’t address your specific question or that have study features that you want to avoid. You may need to look at the studies you find pretty carefully to do this right.
#### Extract Data

Using the relevant studies you have identified, you pull out the information that will help you answer your question. You’ll use a data extraction form to help you organize and categorize what you find.  

#### Analyze and synthesize data

Once the data have been extracted and organized, you will need to carefully evaluate what you have found  and draw conclusions. If you’re conducting meta-analysis, this is where you use statistical tools to combine your data. You may also decide at this point that some of the studies lack sufficient information or are too poor to use.

#### Report your findings

This is the final step. Once you’ve drawn conclusions based on the evidence, you write a clear narrative of the steps you took and what you discovered.

For now, let’s look at how the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health has used systematic reviews to answer important clinical questions.
