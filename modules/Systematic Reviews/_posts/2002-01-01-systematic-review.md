## What is a Systematic Review?


A Systematic Review is a type of evidence synthesis. 

Systematic reviews are among the more rigorous forms of evidence synthesis. In general, they:

- Answer carefully constructed questions.
- Use a clear, transparent and rigorous protocol for selecting, evaluating and extracting evidence. 
- Consider the role of subjectivity and bias in their results
- Involve stakeholders in the process.  

In an article analyzing the different types of evidence synthesis, one academic defined a systematic review as a process that-

“Seeks to systematically search for, appraise and synthesise research evidence, often
adhering to guidelines on the conduct of a review.”<sup> [1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x/full)

Some people think systematic reviews are just pretty good literature reviews based on searches in PubMed or Google Scholar, but they’re much more than that. In a systematic review, we go deeper. We follow a set protocol. We combine our findings and think about bias.
