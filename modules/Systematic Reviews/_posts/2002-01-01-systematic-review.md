## What is a Systematic Review?


A systematic review is a type of evidence synthesis. 

Systematic reviews are among the more rigorous forms of evidence synthesis. In general, they:

- Answer one (or more) carefully constructed question(s)
- Employ a team of librarians, methodologists, statisticians, subject matter experts and stakeholders
- Use a clear, transparent and rigorous protocol for selecting, evaluating and extracting evidence 
- Consider the role of subjectivity and bias in their results
- Involve stakeholders in the process.  

The Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ), which sponsors the creation of systematic reviews to help public and private organizations improve the quality of healthcare, defines systematic reviews as:

> “...the building blocks underlying evidence-based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention.”

AHRQ says systematic reviews are useful because:

> “In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies.” 

Systematic reviews are extremely rigorous but also extremely time and resource-intensive. 
On the next page, we’ll take a closer look at the steps researchers follow when they do this kind of work.
