A systematic review is a type of evidence synthesis. 

Systematic reviews are among the more rigorous forms of evidence synthesis. In general, they:

- Answer one (or more) carefully constructed question(s)
-  Are carried out by a team of librarians, methodologists, statisticians, subject matter experts and stakeholders
- Use a clear, transparent and rigorous protocol for selecting, evaluating and extracting evidence 
- Consider the role of subjectivity and bias in their results
- Involve stakeholders in the process
