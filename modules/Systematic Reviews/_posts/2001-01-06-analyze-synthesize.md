##  Analyze and synthesize data

Once the data have been extracted and organized, you will need to carefully evaluate what you have found and draw conclusions. If you’re conducting meta-analysis, this is where you use statistical tools to combine your data. 

In this step, you describe the characteristics of your studies. What is their quality, their rigor and their scope? What has been studied and what hasn't? Do the studies agree or disagree with each other? Can you reconcile the disagreements? Also, if you’re conducting meta-analysis, this is where you use statistical tools to combine your data.


You may also decide at this point that some of the studies lack sufficient information or are too poor to use.
