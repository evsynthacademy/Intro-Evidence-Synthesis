## How can help Systematic Reviews help us make decisions?


We now know the basic steps for conducting a systematic review to answer a policy or clinical question, so let’s see some examples of this work in action. 

On the next few pages, we’ll walk you through three real systematic reviews conducted by the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health. 

First up, Omega 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular health

**Question**: Should you take Omega 3 fatty acids to prevent strokes, heart attacks or other cardiovascular diseases? 

You’re probably familiar with Omega 3 fatty acids. You can find them in foods such as salmon, flax seeds and walnuts, but they’re often taken as supplements in the form of those golden colored fish oil pills. How do Omega 3 fatty acids improve our health? [If you look online](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/61-health-benefits-omega-3-fatty-acids), you can find claims that they do everything from decrease the spread of breast cancer to treat mental illness. 

The Brown Evidence Based Practice Center (EPC) at the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health (CESH) conducted a systematic review to examine one of these claims: <u>do Omega 3 fatty acids reduce the risk of strokes, heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases</u>? 

**Process**: CESH conducted an exhaustive search of existing research on Omega 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. It threw out studies that weren’t relevant or had questionable research methods. Then, it used statistical methods to combine the results of the studies that remained. 

**Answer**: After looking at all of the available evidence, [CESH found](https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/609/2262/fatty-acids-cardiovascular-disease-report-160913.pdf) that omega-3 fatty acids improved some “intermediate” outcomes (like lower triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins), but found no significant direct relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and “hard, clinical” outcomes like reducing heart attacks and strokes.

**But wait a minute, why have I seen news headlines about Omega 3 fatty acids preventing heart attacks? And why did my doctor tell me to take fish oil pills to protect my health?**

That’s the beauty and the challenge of systematic reviews. 

**The beauty**: Those news headlines were probably based on one study that showed a connection between Omega 3 fatty acids and heart disease. The study may have actually found a direct association with between taking fish oil pills and having fewer heart attacks or it may have found a relationship with an intermediate outcome and inferred a relationship with a hard outcome. By combining the results of *many* studies, CESH was able to see if these results were just a coincidence or part of a real trend. 

**The challenge**: Evidence synthesis can only analyze studies that already exist. So, we can’t conclusively say that Omega 3 fatty acids have no effect on cardiovascular disease. We can only say that after looking at all of the existing research, there’s no evidence that this is the case.
