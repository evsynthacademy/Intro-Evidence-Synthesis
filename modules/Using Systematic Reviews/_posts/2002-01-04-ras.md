## Comparing treatments for Renal Artery Stenosis

Here’s one last example of a systematic review in action. First, some background:

**Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS)** is the narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to the kidneys. RAS is usually caused by a buildup of plaque that clings to the walls of the artery, limiting the flow of blood to the kidneys. RAS can lead to high blood pressure, kidney damage, cardiac disease, stroke, and death.

RAS is treated using medications, but some doctors also recommend opening the blood vessel by inserting a small balloon into the artery to clear away the plaque and improve blood flow. The most common approach for this type of blood vessel repair for patients with RAS is called **Percutaneous Transluminal Renal Angioplasty with Stent placement (PTRAS)**.

CESH conducted a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27536808" target="_blank">systematic review</a>  to compare the benefits and harms of using PTRAS versus using medications alone to treat Renal Artery Stenosis.

**Question**: When treating renal artery stenosis, which approach is better: using medications alone or also clearing the artery using PTRAS?

**Process**: CESH used a series of electronic databases to find studies related to renal artery stenosis, renal hypertension (high blood pressure due to kidney disease), and renal vascular disease (diseases of the kidney blood vessels). It also looked at abstracts and posters from academic conferences, and asked for citations from an expert panel and drug manufacturers to find the most up-to-date research. It then screened the materials, including only studies where researchers followed patients for at least 6 months.


In the end, CESH found:

- 15 studies comparing medication alone versus PTRAS with medication. 
- 48 studies that looked at only one type of intervention: medication alone or PTRAS, without a comparison between the two.
- 20 case reports of individual patient experiences
 
Of the 13 comparative studies, 6 were non-randomized controlled studies and 7 were randomized controlled trials (the gold standard of research).

Researchers included studies that only looked at one type of intervention because they were also interested in the long term outcomes and adverse events assocated with each type of treatment.

In this case, it wasn’t possible to use meta-analysis to combine data from the various studies because the study designs and the types of participants in each study weren’t similar enough. Instead, researchers looked at each study individually and described how their results compared to each other.

**Answer**: When researchers at CESH looked at the relevant articles, the research showed no difference between the outcomes for patients whose RAS was treated using medications alone versus those that underwent PTRAS as well.

But this finding came with a lot of caveats. Some of the existing research had study design problems such as relatively small sample sizes or participants that didn’t match the type of RAS patients doctors are likely to see in their offices. In particular, there were very few studies that examined which types of patients could most benefit from PTRAS. In short, the body of evidence just wasn’t big enough to draw any real conclusions. So, the main findings from this systematic review were:

1.  There’s a need for more research on this topic
2. The current evidence does not support the clinical preference for using PTRAS instead of just medication to treat RAS. 

Now that you’ve seen systematic reviews in action, you might want to use this rigorous form of evidence synthesis to answer your own questions.  A systematic review might be the right tool for you. But first, let’s be clear about what systematic reviews can’t do.
