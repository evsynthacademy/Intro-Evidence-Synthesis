# The beauty and the challenge of Evidence Synthesis


**But wait a minute, why have I seen news headlines about Omega 3 fatty acids preventing heart attacks? And why did my doctor tell me to take fish oil pills to protect my health?**

That’s the beauty and the challenge of Evidence Synthesis. 

**The beauty**: Those news headlines were probably based on one study that showed a connection between Omega 3 fatty acids and heart disease. By combining the results of many studies, the CESH was able to see if these results were just a coincidence or part of a real trend. 

**The challenge**: Evidence synthesis can only analyze studies that already exist. So, we can’t conclusively say that Omega 3 fatty acids have no effect on cardiovascular disease. We can only say that after looking at all of the existing research, there’s no evidence that this is the case.
