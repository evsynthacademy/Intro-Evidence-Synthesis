## How can Evidence Synthesis Help Us Make Decisions

We now know that Evidence Synthesis is the process of combining existing research and evidence to answer a question. Evidence Synthesis can be as basic as a literature review or as complex as a systematic review. 

Here’s an example of a question the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health (CESH) examined using Evidence Synthesis:

**Question**: Should you take Omega 3 fatty acids to prevent strokes, heart attacks or other cardiovascular diseases? 

You’re probably familiar with Omega 3 fatty acids. You can find them in foods such as salmon, flax seeds and walnuts, but they’re often taken as supplements in the form of those golden colored fish oil pills. How do Omega 3 fatty acids improve our health? If you look online, you can find claims that they do everything from decrease the spread of breast cancer to treat mental illness. 



The Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health (CESH) conducted a systematic review to examine one of these claims: ***Do Omega 3 fatty acids reduce the risk of strokes, heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases?*** 

**Process**: The CESH conducted an exhaustive search of existing research on Omega 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. It threw out studies that weren’t relevant or had questionable research methods. Then it used statistical methods to combine the results of the studies that remained (read more about the steps of a [systematic review here]()). 

**Answer**: After looking at all of the available evidence, [CESH found no evidence that Omega 3 fatty acids prevent cardiovascular diseases](https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/609/2262/fatty-acids-cardiovascular-disease-report-160913.pdf).
