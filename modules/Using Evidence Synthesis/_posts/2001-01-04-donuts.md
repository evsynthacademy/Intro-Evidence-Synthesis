## Do It Yourself Evidence Synthesis: Find the Best Donuts

The CESH uses statistical analysis and fancy search terms to answer questions about health interventions, but Evidence Synthesis doesn’t have to be that complicated. You probably already use Evidence Synthesis in your own life. Every time you use Angie’s List to find a plumber or Yelp to find a good restaurant, you’re analyzing existing research to answer a question. Let’s say you’re looking for the best place to buy donuts in Providence, Rhode Island. 

First, you have to **figure out the best way to ask your question**: Are you searching for Donuts? Best Donuts? Vegan Donuts? Or should you type in Doughnuts?

And maybe other details matter to you. Are you looking for a donut shop that’s open right now? Do you want one that’s in your neighborhood? How much are you willing to spend?

Once you’ve settled on the best way to ask your question, **you look at the existing evidence**. Think of each Yelp review as an individual research study.

So far, you’ve followed the initial steps of evidence synthesis:

1. **Define and refine your question**
2. **Look at the existing evidence**

The next step describes what you do when you’ve gathered your evidence, or the Yelp reviews. You don’t just blindly read these donut shop reviews. You **screen your evidence** for comments that seem relevant and trustworthy.
