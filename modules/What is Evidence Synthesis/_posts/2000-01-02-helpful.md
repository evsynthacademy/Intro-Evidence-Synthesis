## Why is Evidence Synthesis Helpful? 

<br>

Evidence Synthesis is helpful because it can:
<ul>
<li>Help with information overload</li>
<li>Combine small studies together for more powerful findings</li>
<li>Describe variation and explain apparent discrepancies in existing research</li>
<li>Examine whether a finding varies under different conditions</li>
<li>Be updated as new information arises</li>
<li>Identify research gaps and needs for future studies</li>
</ul>

We will describe these benefits further on the following pages.
