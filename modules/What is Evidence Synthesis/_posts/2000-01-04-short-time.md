  title: "What if you are short on time?"

## What if you don’t have the time and resources for a systematic review?

Systematic reviews, especially those that include meta-analysis, require extensive time and resources. If you are short on either of these, a **rapid review** might meet your needs. It’s an abbreviated form of a systematic review that is less comprehensive but still follows a scientific approach to gathering and synthesizing information. 

Depending on your question, you might also use these types of evidence synthesis:

- **Scoping review**: Offers a summary of existing evidence by examining the size and scope of literature on a particular topic to understand if enough evidence exists to conduct a systematic review.
- **Evidence map**: Similar to a scoping review, but includes an analysis of what type of studies are missing from a body of evidence by identifying gaps and recommending new areas of research. Our colleague Stacey Springs is using evidence mapping in a project with the Arts and Health Research Network. 

In the world of evidence synthesis, some of these terms are used interchangeably, which can be confusing.

Now that we know evidence synthesis can take various forms, let’s talk about the gold standard for evidence synthesis, the type we typically conduct at the CESH: a systematic review.
