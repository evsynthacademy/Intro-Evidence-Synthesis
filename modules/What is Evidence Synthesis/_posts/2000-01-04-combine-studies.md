## Combine small studies together for more powerful findings 

<br>

A small research study might lack enough participants or evidence to distinguish signal from noise, but when itâ€™s put in context with other similar studies, it can help paint a larger picture.  For instance, a study of 20 people may be too small to establish a relationship between practicing meditation and decreasing blood pressure, but if multiple studies show a similar effect, the evidence is more compelling.
