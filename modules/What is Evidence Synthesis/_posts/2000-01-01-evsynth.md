What do we mean when we use the term “evidence synthesis”? In the broadest terms, evidence synthesis describes the act of combining and analyzing existing information to learn what’s known and not known about a particular topic. The act of using Angie’s List to find a plumber or Yelp to pick out a restaurant can count as evidence synthesis. 

But such syntheses are often not very scientific: they don’t necessarily have a well-defined question, a plausible hypothesis or rigorous search and evaluation methods. When we talk about evidence synthesis in this context, we’re discussing how researchers <u>use scientific methods to systematically gather and analyze existing information.</u>
