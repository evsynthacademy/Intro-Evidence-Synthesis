***Evidence Synthesis*** describes an approach that combines existing research to learn what’s known and not known about a particular topic. In some cases, new studies and analyses are developed to fill in the gaps and complement existing studies.

People who use Evidence Synthesis answer a question not by designing a new study, but by examining how that question has already been addressed in other studies. 

***Evidence Synthesis*** is helpful because it can:

- Help with information overload
- Combine small studies together for more powerful findings
- Address inconsistencies or variations in existing research
- Update old information

Systematic Reviews are a ***type*** of Evidence Synthesis.
