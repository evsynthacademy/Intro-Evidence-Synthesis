## What is Evidence Synthesis?

What do we mean when we use the term “evidence synthesis”? In the broadest terms, evidence synthesis describes the act of combining and analyzing existing information to learn what’s known and not known about a particular topic. The act of using Angie’s List to find a plumber or Yelp to pick out a restaurant can count as evidence synthesis. 

But such syntheses are often not very scientific: they don’t necessarily have a well-defined question, a plausible hypothesis or rigorous search and evaluation methods. When we talk about evidence synthesis in this context, we’re discussing how researchers <u>use scientific methods to systematically gather and analyze existing information.</u> 

Evidence Synthesis is helpful because it can:

- **Help with information overload**<br>
As the rate of medical research continues to climb, it’s impossible to keep up with the latest findings. Evidence synthesis combines that information into a digestible and useable format.
- **Combine small studies together for more powerful findings**<br>
A small research study might lack enough participants or evidence to draw any useful conclusions, but when it’s put in context with other similar studies it can help paint a larger picture.  For instance, a study of 20 people may be too small to find a relationship between practicing meditation and decreasing blood pressure, but if multiple studies show a similar effect, the evidence is more compelling.
- **Address apparent inconsistencies or variation in existing research**<br>
Are there really health benefits associated with drinking red wine? What about eating dark chocolate? The answer seems to depend on the latest study. Evidence synthesis gets beyond the confusing headlines to look at the entire body of research on a topic, screening out poorly designed or irrelevant studies and accounting for random variation or study differences. 
- **Determine whether a finding varies under different conditions**<br>
Many interventions work differently for different people or under different conditions. By combining results from different individuals who participate in different studies, it may be possible to determine how groups of individuals vary in the way they respond to different interventions. This heterogeneity can help target treatments at the right targets. 
- **Be continually updated as new information arises**<br>
Once researchers have designed a process for gathering and synthesizing relevant information, that process can be easily updated to capture new research. For example, if researchers conduct a systematic review in 2016 comparing bariatric surgery to gastric bypass surgery, they can rerun their search in 2017 to find new studies and update their research.
- **Identify research gaps and needs for future studies**<br>
Because evidence synthesis takes a comprehensive look at the existing body of knowledge, it captures not only what research already exists but what research is missing. This analysis is helpful for guiding the direction of future studies. For instance, a meta analysis of studies related to the performance of limb prosthesis might find that few studies include women with prosthetic limbs. 
             
We’ll talk more about how we do this later on in the course. First, let’s discuss the various types of evidence synthesis.
