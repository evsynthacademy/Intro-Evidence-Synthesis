***Evidence Synthesis*** describes an approach that combines existing research to learn what’s known and not known about a particular topic. Evidence synthesis is not a new study but a study of studies. 

People who use Evidence Synthesis answer a question not by designing a new study, but by examining how that question has already been addressed in other studies. 

***Evidence Synthesis*** is helpful because it can:

- Help with information overload.
- Combine small studies together for more powerful findings.
- Address inconsistencies or variations in existing research.
-	Identify research gaps and need for future studies .
-	Explore quality of studies and identify potential bias.



There are many types of Evidence Synthesis and we will consider some of these as you work through these modules.
