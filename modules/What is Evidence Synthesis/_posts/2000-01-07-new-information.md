## Be updated as new information arises 

<br>

Once researchers have designed a process for gathering and synthesizing relevant information, that process can be easily updated to capture new research. For example, if researchers conduct a systematic review in 2016 comparing bariatric surgery to gastric bypass surgery, they can rerun their search in 2017 to find new studies and update their work.
